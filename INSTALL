Installation of the Basler pylon Software Suite
================================================

To install the pylon Software Suite for Linux, you need the correct installation
package for your architecture. Basler provides packages for x86_64 and arm64
platforms.

If you're using a Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu) you can choose 
one of the corresponding Debian packages provided with this pylon release.
Alternatively, you can always use the tar.gz files, which will also work for
Linux distributions not based on Debian.

Note
----
To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
your system. On Debian-based platforms, you also need to install the
following packages:
      libglx-mesa0, libgl1, libxcb-xinerama0, libxcb-xinput0, libxcb-cursor0


Installation Using Debian Packages
==================================

The Debian package will always install the pylon Software Suite in the
/opt/pylon directory. On many Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install 
the Debian package by double-clicking the file. Alternatively, follow these 
these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains the pylon Debian package.

  2. Install the Debian packages:
      sudo apt-get install ./pylon_*.deb ./codemeter*.deb
      
During the installation, an environment variable required for pylon GenTL
producers and a permission file for Basler USB cameras are installed
automatically. For this to take effect, you need to log out and log in again to
your Linux system as well as unplug and replug all USB cameras.


Installation of the CodeMeter Runtime
-------------------------------------
To use pylon vTools, the CodeMeter runtime must be installed first.
The CodeMeter runtime is available as Debian package and is archived into a 
tar.gz package together with the pylon Software Suite Debian package.
On many Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install it by double-clicking
the file. Alternatively, follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains the CodeMeter Debian package.
    
  2. Install the package:
      sudo apt-get install ./codemeter*.deb


CoaXPress Cameras (x86_64 only)
-------------------------------
To operate CoaXPress cameras, a specific driver must be installed first. 
After the installation of the pylon Software Suite, this driver can be found
in /opt/pylon/share/pylon/menable-dkms_*.deb.
On many Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install it by double-clicking
the file. Alternatively, use the following command: 
      sudo apt-get install /opt/pylon/share/pylon/menable-dkms_*.deb
      
You need to reboot your system in order to load the driver.


Installation of the Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 (Optional)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 is an optional component that
contains libraries for encoding MPEG-4 video files. You need to download
this package separately from the Basler website in order to be able to create
MPEG-4 files with pylon. 
On many Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install it by double-clicking
the file. Alternatively, follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains the Supplementary Package for
     MPEG-4 Debian package.
    
  2. Install the package:
      sudo apt-get install ./pylon-supplementary-package-for-mpeg-4_*.deb 


Installation using tar.gz files
===============================

This installation procedure assumes that you are going to install the pylon
Software Suite in the /opt/pylon directory. If you choose to install in a
different directory, you'll have to modify the directory names accordingly.
Note: Root permissions are needed to write to /opt.

To install the pylon Software Suite in /opt/pylon follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains the pylon setup tar.gz archive that
     you downloaded from the Basler website.

  2. Extract the setup tar.gz archive into a directory of your choice (replace
     ./pylon_setup if you want to extract into a different directory):
      mkdir ./pylon_setup
      tar -C ./pylon_setup -xzf ./pylon-*_setup.tar.gz

  3. Change to the directory into which you extracted the setup tar.gz:
      cd ./pylon_setup
     
  4. Extract the pylon SDK into /opt/pylon:
      sudo tar -C /opt/pylon -xzf ./pylon-*.tar.gz

  5. Change access rights of the pylon folder:
      sudo chmod 755 /opt/pylon


Installation of the CodeMeter Runtime
-------------------------------------
To use pylon vTools, the CodeMeter runtime must be installed first.
The CodeMeter runtime is available as Debian and RPM package under, e.g.,:
opt/pylon/share/pylon
On many Debian-based Linux distributions, you can install it by double-clicking
the file. Alternatively, follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains the CodeMeter Debian package.

  2. Install the package:
      sudo apt-get install ./codemeter*.deb


USB3 Vision cameras
-------------------
In order to use USB3 Vision cameras, you also need to install the udev-rules to
set up permissions for Basler USB cameras by calling:
      sudo /opt/pylon/share/pylon/setup-usb.sh

After that, unplug and replug all USB cameras to get the udev rules applied.


CoaXPress cameras (x86_64 only)
-------------------------------
For operating CoaXPress cameras, a driver must be installed first. After the 
installation of the pylon Software Suite, this driver can be found in
/opt/pylon/share/pylon/menable-driver-*.tar.gz.

To install the CoaXPress driver, follow these steps: 

  1. Change to the directory where you want to extract the driver to.
  
  2. Extract the driver archive:
      sudo tar -C ./ -xzf /opt/pylon/share/pylon/menable-driver-*.tar.gz
      
  3. Follow the instructions in the ./menable-driver-*/linux/INSTALL file.
      
You need to reboot your system in order to load the driver.

When starting an application (e.g., the pylon Viewer) that requires CoaXPress
support, the GENICAM_GENTLXX_PATH environment variable, i.e., 
GENICAM_GENTL64_PATH for 64-bit systems, must be set.
The /opt/pylon/share/pylon/README document explains how to set this variable. 


Installation of the Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 (optional)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 is an optional component that
contains libraries for encoding MPEG-4 video files. You need to download
this package separately from the Basler website in order to be able to create
MPEG-4 files with pylon.

To install the Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 in /opt/pylon
follow these steps:

  1. Change to the directory that contains the pylon Basler Supplementary
     Package for MPEG-4 setup tar.gz archive that you downloaded from the Basler
     website.

  2. Extract the setup tar.gz archive into a directory of your choice (replace
     ./mpeg4_setup if you want to extract into a different directory):
      mkdir ./mpeg4_setup
      tar -C ./mpeg4_setup -xzf ./pylon-supplementary-package-for-mpeg-4_*_setup.tar.gz

  3. Change to the directory into which you extracted the setup tar.gz:
      cd ./mpeg4_setup
     
  4. Extract the Basler Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 into /opt/pylon:
      sudo tar -C /opt/pylon -xzf ./pylon-supplementary-package-for-mpeg-4_*.tar.gz 


Installation of the pylon Supplementary Package for pylon AI (optional)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The pylon Supplementary Package for pylon AI is an optional component for the
pylon 8.x Software Suite that is required to run AI vTools and the pylon AI Agent.
You need to download this package separately from the Basler website.

For system requirements and installation instructions, refer to the Install 
document that is included in the supplementary package.
